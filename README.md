# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jordan McGhee, and I am a Fullstack Software Developer with experience developing MERN, PERN, and Django applications. I have been building projects for 2+ years and have a certification from [The Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/) software development program. On top of my coding background, I am also an experienced digital designer with 6+ years of experience working at an Atlanta-based SaaS company. 

Now, I'm applying to jobs in tech while working on my own projects, and you can see what I'm up to by checking out my repos or my [website](https://jordanmcghee-portfolio.web.app/)!
