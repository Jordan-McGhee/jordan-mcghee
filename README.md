# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jordan McGhee, and I am a motion designer making a career change to be a software developer! My coding journey began during quarantine when I had extra time thanks to working remotely, and I took to learning Python in my down time. Soon, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp at The Coding Dojo to speed up my learning. Now, I'm tackling my own projects, and you can see what I'm up to by checking out my repos or my [website](https://jordan-mcghee.github.io/)!

- ðŸ”¥ I'm currently working on expanding my knowledge of JavaScript/jQuery/AJAX and tackling the MERN stack
- ðŸ’¬ Get in touch: [jordanmcghee95@gmail.com](mailto:jordanmcghee95@gmail.com) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-mcghee-048939117/).
- ðŸ˜Œ Fun facts: In my spare time (that isn't spent coding), I enjoy weightlifting and learning guitar!
