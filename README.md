# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jordan McGhee, and I am a motion designer working on making a career change to be a software developer! My coding journey began during quarantine when I had extra time thanks to working remotely, and I took to learning Python in my down time. Soon, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp at The Coding Dojo to speed up my learning. Now, I'm tackling my own projects, and you can see what I'm up to by checking out my repos!

- ðŸ”¥ I'm currently working on expanding my knowledge of JavaScript/jQuery/AJAX
- ðŸ’¬ Get in touch: [jordanmcghee95@gmail.com](mailto:jordanmcghee95@gmail.com) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-mcghee-048939117/).
- ðŸ˜Œ Fun facts: In my spare time (that isn't spent coding), I enjoy weightlifting and learning guitar!
